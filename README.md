I created Read Me, a personal library app that allows users to add books and update them as they progress. I built this page using Bootstrap, SASS, and vanilla JavaScript. I also used Parcel as my bundler.


- Information for each book is stored in an object. All book objects are stored in an array and in the browser local storage. A function creates a card for each book using the array.

- Each card is created dynamically and composed of multiple elements. Event listeners, attributes, and Bootstrap classes are added to elements composing each card to provide functionality and styling.

- Users can add or edit books, toggle book reading status, or clear all books from the page. They can also reset the page to a demo state with placeholder books.
