# Read Me - Library App

I created Read Me, a personal library app that allows users to add books and update them as they progress. I built this page using Bootstrap, SASS, and vanilla JavaScript. I also used Parcel as my bundler.

An object is created to store information for each book. All book objects are stored within an array. On page load and other events, a function creates a card for each book object within the array.
Each card is created dynamically and composed of multiple elements. Bootstrap classes, along with event listeners and other attributes are associated to the appropriate elements within each card to ensure styling and functionality.
Users can add or edit books, toggle each book’s reading status, or clear all books from the page. They can also reset the page and restore the demo placeholder books that were present on first load.
The book objects within the array are also stored in the browser’s local storage to promote continuity for users.

Things I learned.
- I became better at writing cleaner code by implementing DRY principles.
- I became more familiar with creating elements using JavaScript.
- I became more familiar with associating attributes and event listeners to dynamically created elements.
- I became more familiar with targeting dynamically created elements.
- I learned how to use localStorage and sessionStorage.
- I became more familiar with Bootstrap to quickly design and create webpages.
- I became more comfortable using SASS to update Bootstrap variables and customize them as needed.
